My name is Patrick Bagot and I'm part of the Christians on Campus club at Berkeley. This week I was baptized during our 
college conference in Sacremento. As a practicing Christian, baptism is a necessary step to becoming
a member of the church, as well the indication that a new life has been born into me, that of our lord Jesus Christ. I was 
baptized with my fellow brothers and sisters as witnesses to this new life. For me, I feel as though I have been regenerated 
and born anew with a newfound sense of duty to the Lord and an apprecation of the Word. Amen
